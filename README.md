Description
-----------

The **inlcolor** package is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package
that provides access to a variety of color schemes. It is designed to
support packages and scripts written by researchers at the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) Idaho National Laboratory Project Office
([INLPO](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/idaho-water-science-center/science/idaho-national-laboratory-project-office)).
The package has a simple and consistent API, and supports qualitative,
diverging, and sequential color schemes. It also supports combining
color palettes using a hinge location, simulates color blindness, and
has few dependencies. The goal of **inlcolor** is to be a single
comprehensive collection of color schemes for maps and graphs in INLPO
publications.

Installation
------------

To install the current release of the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=inlcolor) you can use the
following command in R:

``` r
install.packages("inlcolor")
```

To install the package along with its dependencies, which are required
to run examples in the package help documentation and simulate
partial-color blindness, run:

``` r
install.packages("inlcolor", dependencies = TRUE)
```

To install the development version of the package, you need to clone the
repository and build from source, or run the following commands:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_gitlab(
  repo = "inl/inlcolor@develop",
  auth_token = Sys.getenv("GITLAB_PAT"),
  host = "code.usgs.gov",
  dependencies = TRUE
)
```

Usage
-----

The package provides two main functions for interacting with color
palettes:

-   `get_colors` This function is used to create a vector of `n` colors
    from the specified color scheme. The function supports qualitative,
    diverging, and sequential color schemes. The maximum number of
    colors in a generated palette is dependent on the specified color
    scheme. The function also supports alpha transparency, color stops,
    interpolation bias, and color blindness simulation.
-   `set_hinge` This function is used to set a *hinge* location within a
    color palette. A hinge is a dramatic change in the colors at a
    location appropriate for your data (such as, at sea level). Examples
    are given in the package help pages. To access these documents, run:

``` r
library("inlcolor")
help(package = "inlcolor")
```
